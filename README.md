# BlockDiagonalMFRC
We introduce a novel MFRC framework that overcomes this dependence on attractor separation by employing a modular block-diagonal reservoir structure. Our approach orthogonally projects different chaotic attractors into independent sub-regions of the reservoir's phase space, achieving effective spatial decoupling and precise reconstruction.
